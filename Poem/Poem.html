        <p>
            To the Arab my heart sails<br>
            For a moment my heart waits<br>
            It is my face that narrates<br>
            Ahhh ! My Heart always waits<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <em>Ehh! Sometimes</em> it suffocates<br>
            <em><STRong>However , </STRong></em>it narrates<br>            
        </p>

            Lesson Of The Day :
        </h2>
        <p>
            <Strong>Nobody’s</Strong> born <em>smart</em>. We all start at 0. <Strong>Can’t talk</Strong>, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <em>algebra</em>.<br>
            Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
            There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
            And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
            Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
            <br>
            <em><Strong>Slowly</Strong></em>. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
            Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
            Until one day, you walk.<br>
            One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
            Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
            <br>
            <em>Failing</em> is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
            This. is. learning.<br>
            It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
            You just don’t get it, yet.
            Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
            are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
            Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            <Strong><em>You only have to know one thing:</em></Strong><br>
            <Strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></Strong>
